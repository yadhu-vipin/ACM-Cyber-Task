<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository tracks my journey through cybersecurity lab tasks, focusing on challenges from apprentice-level modules. It outlines the key issues encountered, the solutions applied, and the insights gained while tackling various security vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>Experiences (Apprentice Level)</h2>

<h3>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> XSS is an attack where malicious code is injected into trusted websites, causing the script to be executed in the context of other users' sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Experience:</strong> While working on XSS exercises, I learned how to identify weak points in web applications where XSS attacks could occur. In one scenario, I found a stored XSS vulnerability that enabled me to execute JavaScript in the browser of another user.</p>
<p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Understanding how proper input sanitization and encoding of output can effectively block XSS attacks.</p>



<h3>SQL Injection (SQLi)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SQLi exploits vulnerabilities in database queries, allowing attackers to manipulate them and gain unauthorized access or information.</p>
<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Through SQL injection challenges, I identified how attackers can insert malicious SQL code into forms. A significant case involved bypassing login authentication by injecting SQL commands into a login field.</p>
<p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Realizing the critical need for developers to implement parameterized queries and prepared statements to defend against SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>
